# Car_Price_predict_Capstone_project

This repository contains code to build a web application that predicts the selling price of cars based on various features using machine learning. The model is trained using the Random Forest Regressor algorithm on the car dataset.

# Features
Predict the price of a car based on its features.

Explore the dataset and visualize the data.
